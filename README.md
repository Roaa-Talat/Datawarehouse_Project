    <h2 id="northwind-schema">Northwind Database Schema</h2>
   <p>The Northwind database is a classic and fictional relational database that simulates the operations of a small trading company called Northwind Traders. The database is structured into several tables representing entities such as products, customers, orders, employees, suppliers, and categories. Each table contains attributes relevant to its respective entity, facilitating the storage and management of data related to the company's transactions, inventory, personnel, and interactions with customers and suppliers.</p>
    <h3>Main Tables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Products:</strong> Stores information about the products offered by Northwind Traders.</li>
      <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Maintains the details of the customers who place orders.</li>
      <li><strong>Orders:</strong> Captures the order details, including the customer, order date, and shipping information.</li>
      <li><strong>Order Details:</strong> Stores the individual line items for each order, including the product, quantity, and unit price.</li>

    <h4>Data Staging Area</h4>
    <p>The data staging area plays a pivotal role in the construction of the data warehouse. It serves as an intermediary step where data is collected, transformed, and prepared for integration into the warehouse.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Relevant data is extracted from source systems, such as the Northwind database.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Data undergoes transformations to standardize formats, handle null values, and perform other necessary modifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Loading:</strong> Transformed data is loaded into staging tables within the data warehouse, ensuring cleanliness and consistency for downstream processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="etl-process">ETL Process</h2>
      <p>In this project, I utilized SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to design and implement a robust ETL process for populating a data warehouse, seamlessly integrating diverse data sources. To optimize the ETL, I implemented an incremental load strategy, enabling real-time data integration and analysis. The data warehouse schema supported comprehensive analysis, with fact tables capturing key business metrics complemented by dimension tables providing essential context. By leveraging SSIS and incremental loading, I delivered a solution that empowers stakeholders with timely and accurate insights to drive informed decisions.</p>
    <p>This is a screenshot of the ETL Process for Product Fact Table loading </p>

    <h2 id="deploy and schedule">Deploying and Scheduling</h2>
    <p>In the deployment and scheduling phase, the SSIS catalog facilitated the organization and deployment of SSIS projects, packages, and environments. SQL Server Agent jobs were utilized to automate the execution of SSIS packages, enabling efficient ETL workflows. Each job executed specific SSIS packages responsible for loading dimension and fact tables. By defining job schedules and dependencies, ETL processes ran reliably according to business requirements. The centralized approach streamlined management and integration with other SQL Server components. This framework provided a robust foundation for automating and managing ETL processes, facilitating informed decision-making and driving business outcomes.</p>
